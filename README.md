## Jenkins, SonarQube, and Docker Pipeline Project

This project demonstrates a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins, SonarQube, and Docker.

### Prerequisites

* Docker installed and running
* Jenkins installed and accessible
* SonarQube installed and accessible
* Git client installed
* A GitHub repository containing your project code

### Project Structure

### Pipeline Workflow

1. **Code Commit:** Changes are committed to the GitHub repository.
2. **GitHub Webhook:** A webhook triggers the Jenkins pipeline.
3. **Jenkins Job:** The Jenkins job starts:
    * **Checkout:** Downloads the code from the GitHub repository.
    * **Build:** Builds the project using Docker.
    * **SonarQube Analysis:** Runs SonarQube analysis on the built project.
    * **Push Docker Image:** Pushes the built Docker image to a Docker registry.
    * **Deploy:** Deploys the Docker image to your desired environment.

### Configuration

1. **Dockerfile:** Define how to build the Docker image.
2. **docker-compose.yml:** Define services for running Jenkins and SonarQube.
3. **Jenkinsfile:** Define the pipeline steps in Jenkins.
4. **SonarQube:** Configure SonarQube to analyze your project code.

### Running the Pipeline

1. Build the Docker image: `docker-compose build`
2. Start the services: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Commit changes to your GitHub repository.
4. The pipeline should automatically start and run through the defined steps.

### Monitoring and Logs

* Jenkins: Monitor the pipeline progress and check job logs in the Jenkins web interface.
* SonarQube: View code quality reports and dashboards in the SonarQube web interface.

### Further Customization

* You can customize the pipeline further by adding additional steps, such as unit tests or security scans.
* You can integrate other tools and services into the pipeline to automate your CI/CD workflow.
